# ⚡️ rt Scripts Optimizer

**rt Scripts Optimizer** is a lightweight WordPress plugin that improves your website’s **Core Web Vitals (CWV)** scores by intelligently deferring non-critical JavaScript execution using **Web Worker threads**. This ensures a snappy, interactive experience for users by keeping the **main thread free** during page load.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Worker Thread Script Loading**  
  Loads JavaScript via Worker Threads, deferring script execution until user interaction (click, scroll, tap, keypress), improving First Input Delay (FID).

- ❌ **Disables Default Emojis Script**  
  Removes WordPress’s default Emoji script to reduce render-blocking JS.

- ⚙️ **Script Whitelisting Support**  
  Allows you to exclude certain scripts from being deferred if they cause issues.

## 🧠 Why Use This Plugin?

If you're trying to:
- Fix **poor CWV metrics** on PageSpeed Insights
- Improve **FID**, **LCP**, and **CLS**
- Defer third-party JS without manually editing theme files
- Keep the **main thread idle** during page load

Then this plugin is a great fit. It automatically detects and defers scripts without any code changes needed from your end.

## 📦 When Should I Use It?

Use this plugin if:
- You're seeing performance warnings related to JS blocking the main thread
- Your site is JS-heavy (e.g., page builders, animations, tracking)
- You want a **non-invasive optimization solution** that doesn’t modify core theme files

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The plugin hooks into the `script_loader_tag` using `rt_scripts_handler`.
2. It changes script tags generated by `wp_enqueue_scripts` to:
   ```html
   <script type="text/rtscript" src="..."></script>
